/*
* The skip operator creates a stream that skips the first items emitted by the observed stream and emits the remainder.
* skip accepts a number of items, but also provides a time-based variant skipping all items emitted during a given time window.
* skipLast is the mirror operator trimming the end of the stream.

The take operator creates a stream which emits only the first items emitted by the observed stream.
As skip, take provides a time-based variant and a takeLast variant.
